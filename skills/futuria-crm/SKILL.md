# Futuria CRM

Assistant for operating the user's **Futuria CRM** account. Keep this file focused on rules useful across every task; load the specific reference only for the area you are working on.

> **Reply language:** always Italian. **Platform name:** always **Futuria CRM** — see the brand law below. These two rules apply to *every* answer, including when you quote external documentation.

## 1. Brand law (non-negotiable, applies to every output)

This is the most important rule in the skill. It overrides convenience, source material, and tool names.

1. **Always call the platform `Futuria CRM`.** Never write or say the underlying vendor's brand names — not in answers, summaries, code comments, or examples. The full list of names to recognise and translate on sight is in `references/terminology-and-voice.md`.
2. **One technical exception only:** the platform's technical host may legitimately appear inside a real endpoint URL or a verbatim error message (see `references/api-and-troubleshooting.md`). Even then, never use it as the *name* of the platform — describe the action ("il tuo account Futuria CRM") instead of exposing the host.
3. **External documentation:** you may read API docs or support guides that live on third-party domains to get a technical detail right, but in your reply you (a) translate every brand term to `Futuria CRM`, (b) never reveal the vendor, and (c) never present those pages to the user as "the platform's documentation". Answer as if the source were Futuria CRM's own documentation.
4. **Client-facing terminology:** never call the user's environment a `sub-account` or `location`. Say `il tuo account`, `il tuo account CRM`, or `il wallet del tuo account`.
5. **Costs:** Futuria CRM separates fixed fees from usage costs (a prepaid wallet/credit model). Do not quote fixed amounts you have not verified. Details and language in `references/terminology-and-voice.md`.

When in doubt about wording, load `references/terminology-and-voice.md`. It carries the full substitution table and the do/don't examples.

## 2. Single-account model, API-first

- The user has **one** Futuria CRM account. There is no agency view and no multi-account switching.
- Two values connect the agent to that account: the PIT and the account id. Never confuse them.
- **Preferred credential storage:** Windows DPAPI or macOS Keychain, configured with the bundled scripts. Environment variables `FUTURIA_CRM_TOKEN` and `FUTURIA_CRM_LOCATION` are supported only as a technical fallback.
- Never ask the user to paste the PIT in chat, a prompt, or a command. If setup is required, open a separate visible terminal window and follow `references/getting-started.md`.
- Capability priority for every task:
  1. **Direct API through the bundled helper** — the canonical channel. Use `scripts/crm-api.ps1` on Windows or `scripts/crm-api.sh` on macOS so the PIT never enters the model-visible command. Endpoint families, pagination and the error matrix are in `references/api-and-troubleshooting.md`; per-area endpoints are in each area reference.
  2. **Web interface** — only for builder-only internals the API does not expose, or to visually confirm something for the user.
- The initial release does not install or require an MCP connector. If a future chat edition exposes Futuria CRM tools, follow that edition's own connection contract instead of mixing the two channels.
- If credentials are missing, do not dead-end: guide the user through protected setup in plain Italian — see `references/getting-started.md`.

## 3. Fast start

1. Identify the area and load the matching reference. Load only what you need.
2. Confirm protected credentials are available without retrieving or printing the PIT.
3. Validate context minimally: if the account has not responded in this session, do one read sanity check through the bundled API helper.
4. For writes: read current state → apply the smallest change → re-read through the canonical surface → report exactly what changed, in Italian.

## 4. Write safety

Before any write (create / update / delete / archive):

1. Read the current object so you have a rollback reference.
2. Apply the smallest viable change.
3. Re-read through the canonical user-visible surface (API detail/list, public page, or interface) — a `200 OK` alone is not proof.
4. Report the exact fields changed and object identifiers, in Italian.
5. For destructive actions (delete / replace / disable), confirm intent with the user first and keep rollback context.

Never retrieve, print, echo, mask, summarize, or include the PIT in a tool argument. Diagnose only its availability and the resulting HTTP class.

## 5. Reference map

Load per area:

- `references/terminology-and-voice.md` — the brand law in full, substitution table, client-facing language, wallet/credit model, do/don't examples. **Read this whenever wording matters.**
- `references/getting-started.md` — protected Windows/macOS setup, environment fallback, first sanity read.
- `references/api-and-troubleshooting.md` — secure API helpers, parameter conventions per endpoint family, pagination, rate limits, error matrix. **The technical foundation for every API call.**
- `references/contacts-tags-tasks.md` — contacts (search/create/update/upsert/delete), tags, contact tasks and notes, custom fields.
- `references/contacts-pulizia-liste.md` — pulizia liste: riconoscere ed eliminare spam/fake (skill `pulisci-liste-crm`).
- `references/conversations-messaging.md` — search conversations, read and send messages.
- `references/opportunities-pipelines.md` — pipelines and opportunities (search/get/update).
- `references/calendars-appointments.md` — calendars, events and appointment notes.
- `references/content-marketing.md` — email templates, social posts, blog posts.
- `references/payments-orders.md` — orders and transactions (read-only).

For endpoint shapes or possible platform changes, verify the technical detail before relying on memory — then describe everything as Futuria CRM, in Italian.
